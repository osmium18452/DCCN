# Spectral-Spatial Hyper-spectral Image Classification Using Dual-Channel Capsule Networks

## ABSTRACT

Deep learning methods have shown their marvel performance on hyper-spectral image (HSI) classification tasks. In 
particular,algorithms based on Convolution Neural Network (CNN) outperforms most of the conventional machine-learing 
based algorithms. Recently, a newly proposed neural network called Capsule Network (CapsNet) showed its potential to 
replace the CNNs in various classification tasks with its amazing performance. In this paper, we proposed a new CapsNet
architecture for HSI classification tasks, called Dual-channel Capsule Network (DCCN). Our DCCN model extracts features 
from spectral and special domain respectively with two separate convolution channels and then concatenates and feds the 
features into the capsule layer to classify each of the HSI pixels. The model is trained on **(2/3/4/5?)** real HSI 
dataset **(Pavia University, Pavia City, Salinas Valley, Salinas A and KSC)** and achieved high accuracy. We also 
compared our network with some of the state-of-art models and found our model was superior to those models.
